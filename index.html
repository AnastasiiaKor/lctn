              In the modern world, blockchain technology emerges as an exciting
              and rapidly evolving field, transforming into a distinct era in
              the history of digital solutions. We believe that sooner or later,
              all accounting systems will leverage the properties of this
              technology. The unique ability to provide decentralized and
              transparent systems has become an integral part of this evolution,
              opening new horizons for various industries. However, against this
              innovative progress, new challenges and issues arise, demanding
              solutions.

            </div>
            <p>
              Fraud schemes exploiting the complexities of blockchain regulation
              are becoming more sophisticated and challenging to overcome. As a
              result, regular users find themselves grappling with security
              threats and the complexity of engaging with innovative
              technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, the average user must consider a myriad of factors when
              managing digital assets:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Security: Striking a balance between easy access to funds and
                avoiding the risk of losing money due to an irresponsible
                service provider.
              </li>
              <li>
                Provable Non-Involvement: Monitoring incoming and outgoing
                transactions for the involvement of transferred funds in various
                fraudulent schemes or theft.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recoverability: Choosing between backing up keys (and how to do
                so) or opting for asset insurance (and trusting the digital
                asset insurer).
              </li>
              <li>
                Manageability: Building a sensible budget management structure,
                both for personal use and for a managed company budget.
              </li>
              <li>
                Audibility: Verifying that the logic of decentralized
                applications truly aligns with the declared goals. Checking for
                intentional or accidental vulnerabilities in smart contract
                code.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is not an exhaustive list, but it suffices to understand that
              effective and secure management of digital assets is a
              labor-intensive process and a comprehensive solution that an
              ordinary user may not always afford.
            </p>
            <p>
              The contrast between the potential of blockchain and the real
              issues faced by users underscores the need for efficient
              regulatory mechanisms and the protection of the interests of
              ordinary participants. This is crucial to ensure the sustainable
              development and safe integration of blockchain into everyday life,
              collectively reducing entry barriers and costs for end-users.

              All these situations are united by the nature of digital assets

            </p>
            <p>
              Blockchain technology is rapidly penetrating various sectors,
              providing unique opportunities. However, on its path to
              integration into the world, there are already significant problems
              that require serious attention and effective regulation.
            </p>
            <p class="subTitle">
              <em>ICO Problem: Litmus Test for Fraud</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              The approach to Initial Coin Offering (ICO), despite its
              popularity, is becoming a platform for fraud. Many projects, using
              promises of high returns, attract investors but turn out to be
              nothing more than a deception. Ponzi schemes and pump-and-dump
              manipulations become commonplace, harming the interests of
              trusting investors. In turn, this also affects good projects -
              users fail to use clear criteria in their selection, and, having
              learned from bitter experience, lump everything related to
              "crypto" under one brush.
            </p>
            <p class="subTitle">
              <em>Lack of Consumer Protection and Taxation Threats</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Blockchain technology provides anonymity (more precisely -
              pseudonymity) when managing digital assets, hiding the real user
              behind an anonymized address. This can lead (and naturally leads)
              to tax evasion and money laundering. Moreover, due to the
              decentralized nature, the lines of taxation are significantly
              blurred - P2P payments are truly P2P; they do not require
              intermediaries or connections between financial institutions for
              processing. The transaction can be initiated directly by the user,
              and its confirmation can be done by an unknown validator. Thanks
              to the mathematical transparency of events in the blockchain,
              regulators can happily observe what is happening, but in reality,
              there is little they can do to protect consumers.
            </p>
            <h3 id="intr2">Between Dreams and Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              The global cryptocurrency market, promising potentially high
              returns, faces a range of issues undermining its stability and
              reliability. One of the main problems is the lack of clear and
              enforceable rules. In such a semi-regulated environment, investors
              often fall victim to fraud, and the absence of legal protection
              only exacerbates the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regulators, seeking to gain control over the crypto industry,
              often employ outdated approaches that could be more effective and
              more counterproductive. For instance, the SEC directly combats
              services and projects, while regional regulators tighten
              regulatory screws, increasing the cost of entry for new solutions
              to enter the market.
            </p>
            <div class="thumb"><img src="./images/2.png" alt="train" /></div>

            <p>
              However, the cryptocurrency market can become an excellent tool
              for expanding the possibilities of the traditional financial
              market. It helps balance the growing volume of assets not backed
              by a solid component.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current regulatory requirements prove cumbersome and convoluted,
              increasing legal risks for market participants or pushing them
              into the "gray" area. For a market based on high technologies, an
              appropriate <strong>high-tech regulatory </strong>approach is
              necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the crypto enthusiasts' environment, the distorted perception
              of freedoms leads to the idealization of the industry as a utopian
              ecosystem. Absolute freedom is more likely to lead to chaos than
              harmony, as the absence of any rules and regulations creates a
              fertile ground for fraud, crime, and other negative phenomena. In
              the financial sector, anarchy has little in common with freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
              For participants who want to operate in accordance with the legal
              framework and have maximum compatibility with the traditional
              financial sector, the implementation of clear criteria and rules
              by regulators is the only possible scenario. Users who do not want
              to engage with the regulated segment can continue to leverage the
              properties of decentralized systems, as before.

              procedures, audits, and checks. This is particularly relevant in
              the context of increasing interest in digital assets from the

                (global-level coordination requires regulators to exhibit a high

              In a scenario where traditional financial institutions are
              integrating crypto assets into their operations, there is an
              urgent need for reliable regulatory mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
              The state, as the primary arbiter in financial matters, is
              responsible for the stability of the economy and the protection of
              its citizens' interests. Therefore, any attempts to create and
              issue digital assets without proper control will be considered a
              threat to economic stability and possibly as unlawful activity.

            <p class="subTitle">
              <em
                >In some blockchain networks, such as Ethereum 2.0, validators
                must stake cryptocurrency. This incentivizes validators to act
                honestly and in the network's best interests. It's evident that
                in regulated systems, any party contributing collateral cannot
                become a validator. Therefore, a separate reputation-based
                mechanism is required.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Validators in a blockchain network play a crucial role by
              confirming the mathematical correctness of transactions and
              ensuring the system's security and maintenance. The presence of
              high-quality validators (government entities, major companies)
              reduces the need for a large number of them. In cryptocurrencies,
              the fate of the system is determined by the majority of unknown
              participants; in a regulated environment, it could be a few
              reputable and trusted organizations (playing by common and
              pre-established rules). Reducing the number of validators enhances
              system throughput and reduces redundancy (costs + computational
              power).
            </p>
            <p>
              Public transparency of validators strengthens the trust of users
              and regulators. The quality and responsibility of validators are
              essential for creating a reliable and resilient blockchain system.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, a separate role in such infrastructures belongs
              to auditors - participants who do not participate in achieving
              consensus but store and synchronize the current state of the
              accounting system to monitor and control all actions performed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, any accredited organization can enhance the transparency of
              processes in the accounting system without impacting its
              throughput.
            </p>
            <h3 id="intr5">Rollups as a way to scale</h3>
            <p class="subTitle">
              <em
                >As of December 27, 2023, over 30 second-layer solutions are
                utilizing Rollup technologies.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let's touch upon the issue of network scalability. The
              throughput of any system, whether centralized or not, is limited.
              For some systems, this limitation is within the range of 3-5
              transactions per second (tps), while for others, it can be tens of
              thousands of tps. As the level of decentralization increases, the
              reverse effect becomes a decrease in its throughput (influencing
              the consensus process among validators).
            </p>
            <p>
              Another crucial aspect is unpredictability. When designing an
              accounting system, developers must consider the potential load on
              it. Depending on these requirements, specific technologies may be
              chosen for implementation (consensus mechanism, accounting model,
              etc.). However, if situations of overestimated load don't
              critically impact the system, underestimating it leads to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                competition within block limits and consequently, an increase in
                transaction fees;
              </li>
              <li>service denial to users who cannot compete.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              One method of scaling an accounting system is through rollups. A
              key distinction is their ability to launch parallel subsystems
              without altering the basic architecture of the accounting system
              (unlike sharding). At the L1 level, each such subsystem is
              represented by a verification smart contract, periodically
              updating the state.
            </p>
            <p>
              Briefly, the functioning of zkRollups can be described as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Users submit transactions to L2 (second-level subsystems) that
                operate concurrently with the main network. Transactions stand
                out for their speed and cost-effectiveness.
              </li>
              <li>
                The L2 operator (sequencer) aggregates these transactions into a
                single "rollup" or "batch." The operator generates a
                zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARK) confirming the validity of all
                transactions in the rollup, adhering to the network rules.
              </li>
              <li>
                This "batch" of transactions and the zero-knowledge proof are
                sent to the main network. Validators on the main network verify
                the proof (regarding state transition). After successful proof
                verification, all transactions in the rollup are considered
                confirmed on the main network (considering assumptions about the
                finality of the main network).
              </li>
              <li>
                The state of accounts or smart contracts involved in these
                transactions is updated on the main network, taking into account
                all transactions conducted on L2.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              It's also important to note that the proof of the validity of the
              final state of the rollup can be verified by any participant in
              the network.
            </p>
            <div class="thumb"><img src="./images/4.png" alt="schema" /></div>
            <p>
              The key advantage of zk-rollups is their ability to process a
              large number of transactions off the main chain, followed by the
              submission of only the final state hash and proof to the main
              blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              This increases significantly the network throughput and reduces
              transaction costs, making the technology highly appealing for a
              wide range of solutions, from financial operations to
              decentralized applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, a bit about zkEVM. Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine is
              a technology that aims to combine zero-knowledge proof technology
              with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              While some zk rollups can efficiently aggregate simple
              transactions like digital asset transfers, implementing them for
              smart contracts is challenging. zkEVM represents an attempt to
              make zero-knowledge proofs compatible with the full functionality
              of the EVM, including all OP codes.
            </p>
            <div class="thumb"><img src="./images/5.png" alt="rollups" /></div>
            <p>Why it matters:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                A developer creates a smart contract and deploys it on L2
                (zkEVM-compatible).
              </li>
              <li>Transactions are initially processed on L2.</li>
              <li>
                After several transactions are bundled in a rollup, a
                zero-knowledge proof (zkp) is generated for the entire package.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then, this proof is verified and recorded on the main network.
              </li>
              <li>
                After successful verification, the state of all involved smart
                contracts is updated on the main network.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              In an era where blockchain technologies become an integral part of
              the financial and corporate world, zero-knowledge rollups stand
              out as one of the most promising solutions for optimizing
              throughput and enhancing confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p>
              These algorithmic constructs not only simplify the transactional
              load on the main network but also provide cryptographic anonymity,
              allowing validation of transactions without revealing their
              content. In this combination, we achieve mathematically
              substantiated anonymity that satisfies regulators.
            </p>
            <p>
              The integration of this technology represents a step forward in
              creating more efficient, secure, and scalable blockchain
              ecosystems.

              <li>
                <strong> Transparency and Privacy:</strong> the system should
                ensure complete transaction transparency for specific
                participants while maintaining the confidentiality of data for

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Speed: high throughput</strong> - the system should be

              <li>
                <strong>Scalability: </strong>the system's ability to adapt to

                to be processed in a unit of time).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legislative Compliance:</strong> the ability to easily

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Control and Reporting:</strong> built-in tools for
                monitoring, conducting audits, and generating reports,
                accessible only to authorized parties.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Compatibility at Various Levels:</strong> API and SDK -
                the presence of a comprehensive set of APIs and SDKs to
                facilitate integration with other systems and applications.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Now, in accordance with the criteria outlined above, let's
              describe the capabilities of the "ideal" platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Such a platform provides an environment where each user has a
              significant number of rights and freedoms. These freedoms are
              based on the platform's ability to control user actions to comply
              with established policies. The ability to generate real-time
              reports is ensured without revealing private information. In the
              context of the modern financial world, where the presumption of
              guilt prevails over objectivity, this platform creates a fairer
              and more transparent environment, addressing issues of bias and
              lack of transparency in financial matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              This system ensures privacy until a breach of the law (certain
              system rules) occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's an honest and fair agreement that eliminates the need to
              exaggerate requirements or prohibit certain operations that the
              regulator could not track before.
            </p>
            <p>
              In such a system, it's sufficient to undergo the identification
              process once, after which compliance checks can be conducted in
              various services without disclosing personal data. These features
              apply not only to applications deployed on the main platform but
              also to all connected rollups.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, let's add the ability to work with hundreds of
              crypto assets in various network services, including the ability
              to create your own smart contracts, launch L2 projects, integrate
              with the network via APIs, and provide network services to your
              users, even if you have a small project!
            </p>
            <p>
              A platform built on these principles will be distributed among
              institutional validators, and fishers, owners of full nodes
              (auditor nodes), representing the community, will be responsible
              for public control.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a regulator owning such a system, there is no need to set
              procedural barriers, restrict the banking sector from the crypto
              segment, or prohibit any activity due to the inability to control
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The legal framework, designed with technological regulation in
              mind, will be concise and enforceable, and the deployment of a
              platform capable of attracting a wave of investments to the region
              is possible in a short period.
            </p>
            <p>
              Society is quite accepting of existing state telecommunications
              networks, unitary railway and aviation enterprises. Why can't
              state blockchain platforms emerge? It's an excellent consolidating
              solution for the circulation of crypto assets, launching projects,
              and operating existing services willing to work within the legal
              framework of specific jurisdictions!

            </div>
            <p>
              At the physical level, Lockton One consists of a group of
              specialized computers called validator nodes that interact with
              each other to coordinate the current state of the system. There
              are also auditor nodes that maintain a copy of the current state
              of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core of the system, called Core Services Backend, processes
              various services such as identity verification, creating platforms
              for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), building
              systems for anonymous transactions, and other tasks that require
              the use of servers. The Core Services Backend is like a framework
              that connects a set of individual servers, not a single server
              that performs all functions simultaneously.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each application running on Lockton One can include external and
              internal modules that operate on different physical devices.
            </p>
            <p>The basic logical architecture includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <strong>Lockton core</strong> includes
                <strong>validator nodes</strong> operating in accordance with
                QBFT consensus. The Ethereum virtual machine ensures the
                execution of operations to change the core's state. CRUD
                policies control the logic of deploying and managing smart
                contracts at the consensus level.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <strong>smart contract</strong> level is built on top of the
                <strong>Lockton core</strong>
                and is responsible for managing roles and permissions.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <strong>Backend module</strong> includes identity
                verification (KYC) services and integration with existing (web2)
                solutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Auditor nodes</strong> have almost the same logic as
                <strong>validator nodes</strong>, but they cannot participate in
                achieving <strong>consensus</strong>. Their main goal is to
                locally preserve the system's state and verify that everything
                in it is functioning normally.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Authorized dApps store:</strong> the user goes through
                the registration process and gains access to a list of
                applications that they have permission to interact with (based
                on their identity and permissions).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Account abstraction:</strong> allows the implementation
                of arbitrary complex account management logic.
              </li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <h4 id="hoodlow1">Account abstraction</h4>
            <p>Use Cases (why it’s needed):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Assets</strong> can be <strong>frozen</strong> on the
                account if the user is suspected of some illegal activity;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Assets</strong> can be <strong>transferred</strong> from
                the account to a new one in case some number of trusted
                authorities agree on that (for example, in case of losing access
                to the account, the user can restore access if his family
                members and close friends confirm that);
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>KYC</strong> provider <strong>services</strong> will
                have the ability to <strong>restore access</strong>
                to the account in case users lose their keys after they prove
                their identity;
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Applications</strong> can get some kind of
                <strong>limited access</strong> to users` accounts. For example,
                a game will receive a limited access key to interact only with
                game smart contracts. This will eliminate the need for users to
                sign transactions for each interaction, thus improving user
                experience without compromising security.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Applications will need to pass the verification process and get
              corresponding roles. Then they can interact with the Lockton Core
              through RBAC (role-based access control) defined on the smart
              contract layer of the protocol. The corresponding backend module
              is responsible for the verification process. This centralized
              service will check users/application documentation and emit
              corresponding roles that will grant access to the Lockton One
              protocol.

                allow the form of local communities with their own governance
                rules with custom rules (including anonymous voting).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>ZK rollup constructor:</strong> this module will allow
                you to construct verifiable rollup-based applications by setting
                up the rules of the application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Decentralized shared sequencer:</strong> A shared
                sequencer can handle atomic cross-rollup operations (when
                transactions are executed either on both rollups or are not
                executed at all). It also eliminates a single point of failure
                of centralized sequencer architecture and allows fast
                transaction finality on rollups.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="hood2">The number of accounts</h3>
            <p>
              The Lockton protocol network will operate at the national level,
              capable of handling millions of accounts with scalability.
              Technical constraints are related to the number of requests, and
              the system plans to process up to ~1000 requests per second, with
              the potential for further scalability. It is important to note
              that EVM operates with 160-bit addresses, allowing storage of up
              to ~2^160 ≈ 10^47 accounts, which is a crucial aspect of the
              system. By using accumulator batches, the system can achieve
              performance of tens of thousands of transactions per second and
              support millions of users.
            </p>

                The aim of future improvements: ~100’000-200’000 active users,
                10’000’000-50’000’000 in total.</em
              >
            </p>

            <h3 id="hood3">Performance requirements</h3>
            <p>
              The basic version of the Lockton One protocol processes about 100
              transactions per second. For node validators, servers of average
              power are sufficient. Performance is enhanced by applications
              based on accumulation packets, storing transactions on their
              equipment and periodically sending proofs to the system. This
              allows Lockton Core to guarantee compliance with protocol rules.
              Storing unprocessed transactions by applications enhances
              performance but also carries risks (potential loss of access). A
              decentralized shared sequencer can address this issue, ensuring
              data availability. Several independent sequencers will solve
              bottleneck issues, improving scalability to tens of thousands of
              transactions per second. Validator nodes will not directly process
              view requests to prevent DOS attacks, while auditor nodes will
              keep a copy of the system state, executing complex view queries.

            <h3 id="hood4">API and the model of API reaching</h3>
            <p>
              The Lockton One protocol will use JSON-RPC API (remote procedure
              call) to receive application requests. This API can be used for
              managing an account (check balances, send transactions),
              deployment, management, and interaction with smart contracts,
              blockchain data retrieval, event handling, etc. The main
              difference with the Ethereum API is that all requests (even “GET”
              that does not change the system state) should be signed because of
              the permissioned design of the system. Only authorized parties can
              review the system state.
            </p>
            <p>
              To communicate between nodes, a peer-to-peer protocol will be used
              (specifically DevP2P, which is commonly used in Ethereum-like
              networks). Those communications will include data synchronization,
              transactions and blocks broadcasting and propagation, consensus
              reaching, state updates, etc. Auditor nodes will synchronize with
              the network state using the same peer-to-peer protocol.

            <h3 id="hood5">Smart contract supporting</h3>
            <p>
              The Lockton One protocol is based on a modified version of Geth
              (Ethereum node written in Go). It executes EVM-smart contracts,
              meaning that most existing dApps can migrate to the protocol with
              few changes in the base code. Still, the Lockton protocol has
              several peculiarities, as its aim is the creation of a regulated
              environment supported by authorities, which means that
              applications will need to implement protection against interaction
              with unauthorized users. The protocol provides built-in tools that
              make it much easier to integrate existing solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, Ethereum Virtual Machine has several significant
              drawbacks (mainly in the performance parameters), so in future
              releases, a parallel VM that will execute WebAssembly (WASM) can
              be built in. This will allow the protocol to execute complex
              operations more efficiently. For more information about the WASM
              VM module function, see the Additional Protocol Enhancements
              section.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The protocol uses computation credits (CC) to incentivize and
              protect its work from spam. With account abstraction, it’s
              possible to create a model where the application will pay for the
              user (and receive the revenue based on its business model). When
              the user forms the transaction, it will be sent to the application
              aggregator, the final publisher of transactions, and a transaction
              fee will be paid. Those credits will be provided (sold) by the
              protocol owners (like the government).
            </p>
            <p>
              Applications develop their business model to get resources for

              would not directly pay fees to the Lockton One protocol.
            </p>
            <h3 id="hood7">System protection methods</h3>
            <p>
              The Lockton One protocol is a permissioned network. Permissioned
              blockchain platforms require all participants to be identified and
              authorized, making it more difficult for attackers to access the
              network. All users and nodes should be required to authenticate
              with strong credentials, and access to sensitive data and
              functions should be restricted to authorized users and nodes.
            </p>
            <div class="thumb">
              <img src="./images/14.png" alt="protection methods" />
            </div>
            <p>
              DOS-protection mechanisms (IP blacklisting/whitelisting, request
              rate limitation, backup nodes usage) should be implemented to
              protect validation nodes from failure by executing
              denial-of-service attacks, as well as spam and flood attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Protection from a Sybil attack is done by the fact that the
              network is permissioned, and to access it, users should pass the
              know-your-customer (KYC) verification process, which makes the
              execution of such an attack extremely hard.
            </p>
            <p>
              An attack with history reorganizing does not make much sense, as
              it can be executed only if an attacker controls the government
              that runs the system. In that case, there is not much the system
              can do. Otherwise, if an attacker does not control the government,
              the system will fail if an attacker can make more than 33% of
              nodes act maliciously, which is practically impossible because
              those nodes are controlled by the government, which an attacker
              does not have control over. BFT-based consensus mechanisms allow
              instant transaction finality; if validators have agreed on the
              state change, they cannot revert it.
            </p>
            <h3 id="hood8">Consensus reaching mechanism</h3>
            <p>
              In blockchain networks with a limited number of participants, it
              does not make sense to use unproductive and fully distributed
              consensus types like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. The
              BFT-based consensus-reaching mechanism will be used to get high
              transaction throughput and finality in a permissioned system.
              Specifically - QBFT (Quorum Byzantine Fault Tolerance) is a
              modification of Istanbul BFT. QBFT works in permissioned
              protocols, meaning only pre-approved nodes can participate in the
              consensus process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main objective of these mechanisms is the increased
              simplicity, reliability, and performance in closed networks, which
              simultaneously fully preserve the main properties of private
              blockchains - immutability, verifiability, and traceability of
              data.
            </p>

              <img src="./images/15.png" alt="consensus mechanism" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Consensus algorithms based on BFT can scale to a significant
              number of nodes without compromising performance and security.

            <h3 id="hood9">Number of validators should support the system</h3>
            <p>
              Number of validators that should support the system depends on
              security and performance requirements, as well as protocol
              consensus limitation. The minimum number of validator nodes that
              can reach consensus under QBFT consensus is 4, and the recommended
              number depends on the expected fault tolerance (the system's
              operational resilience in the presence of potentially malicious
              nodes). Because the protocol is permissioned and validators are
              selected or operated by the “government” entity, the system can
              stay relatively secure even with a few validator nodes.

            <h3 id="hood10">Users roles and their permissions</h3>
            <p>
              Lockton network is a permissioned network, meaning users should
              receive permission to interact with it. Specifically, we expect
              Lockton One to have role-based access control, which means that
              each user will have roles that will allow them to perform some
              specific set of operations on the network. <br />For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>KYC-passed user</li>
              <li>Application</li>
              <li>
                Job-specific roles (police, medical staff, certified trader)
              </li>
              <li>Authorities roles</li>
              <li>Regional roles (citizens of city X)</li>
              <li>Taxes roles (legal entity, individual)</li>
              <li>Other</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <h3 id="hood11">Supported Asset Types in the System</h3>
            <p>
              The default system asset is Computation Credits, primarily
              utilized for network operation payments. In addition to
              Computation Credits, applications have the flexibility to
              introduce their own asset types. These assets can conform to
              industry-standard token standards like
              <strong>ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155,</strong> or may employ custom
              application-specific logic. Contracts with custom logic should be
              verified by authorities and whitelisted.
            </p>
            <h3 id="hood12">Should the privacy of transactions be achieved?</h3>
            <p>
              Network data will be open to permitted applications. The current
              protocol design allows applications deployed on top of the Lockton
              One protocol to operate in two formats: directly perform
              transactions and use rollup-based operation models. The first one
              is pretty straightforward: applications with permission and
              computational credits can execute transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second one has some challenges: for applications to run their
              rollup systems, some zk-circuits should be implemented. However,
              applications may have different logic and cannot all be verified
              by the same circuit. At the same time, the Lockton protocol is
              controlled by the government, and the government should decide
              what schemes are allowed and which are not. To address this issue,
              some constructor-like systems that will consist of
              government-approved functionality should be built. In that case,
              applications would just construct their business logic out of
              approved components. This will allow the protocol to have
              application-specific rollups without losing security.

            </div>
            <p>
              Base cryptographic mechanisms are the same as in the Ethereum:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>ECDSA key pair</strong> (specifically secp256k1). ECDSA
                is a cryptographic method used for creating digital signatures,
                and secp256k1 is a specific set of elliptic curve parameters
                used in this context for key pair generation. This parameter set
                ensures security and efficiency within the ECDSA algorithm.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Keccak256 hash function.</strong> A cryptographic
                function used to transform input data of arbitrary length into a
                unique string of fixed length, known as the hash value. It is
                part of the Keccak family of hash functions designed to provide
                security in various cryptographic protocols.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built-in <strong>precompiled contracts</strong> (ecRecover,
                SHA256, RIPEMD-160, ModeExp, ecAdd, ecMul, ecPairing over
                alt_bn128, Blake2).
              </li>
              <li>
                The <strong>identity verification module</strong> will use EdDSA
                to sign statements that users undergo the KYC process.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <strong>Rollup module</strong> will use zk-SNARK
                (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge,
                specifically the Groth16 scheme) to efficiently verify the
                authenticity of Rollup transactions without compromising the
                system's privacy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Decentralized sequencers will use the
                <strong>Verified Information Distribution</strong> (VID) scheme,
                specifically AVID-1 (Asynchronous Verified Information
                Distribution 1). Other storage implementations within the
                protocol may also use this data storage scheme.
              </li>
              <li>
                The module for <strong>organizing anonymous voting</strong> will
                use Merkle Trees, as well as zk-SNARK.
              </li>
              <li>
                zk-schemes are required for
                <strong>proving confidential data</strong>. The use of zkSQL
                (additional research required) is also possible.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="hood14">Approaches to the key management</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the permissioned design of the system, users will not be
              able to use popular digital wallets (like MetaMask or
              TrustWallet), as it involves additional cryptographic mechanisms
              being implemented to protect the system from unauthorized
              requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lockton One protocol has many differences from the existing
              systems, so a solution should be engineered to create a
              protocol-compatible wallet. One of the solutions is to use
              MetaMask Snaps, which will allow adding custom logic to the
              MetaMask to be compatible with the Lockton One protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each solution has its benefits and disadvantages. Modifying the
              framework basic wallet will allow the implementation of any custom
              logic, but users need to install another extension, while MetaMask
              is the most commonly used digital wallet. It is worth noting that
              both solutions may be implemented, which will allow a user to
              select the preferred one.
            </p>
            <p>
              The account-based system will allow users to implement the logic
              for restoring access to the account in case of losing access to
              the keys (see part 21 for more details).

            <h3 id="hood15">Requirements for the data storage</h3>
            <p>
              Based on the system's purpose, we split stored data into three
              main groups:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Public:</strong> <br />Every user with access to the
              Lockton One protocol can access this data. Examples of public data
              can include weather forecasts, research papers, public registers,
              etc. Information dispersal schemes (like AVID-1) might be used to
              store such data persistently.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Private:</strong> <br />This includes the data open only
              to some subset of parties in the Lockton One protocol. An example
              of private data is the Lockton Core blockchain history (available
              only for authorities and authorized applications deployed on the
              network). This may also include private registers (like criminal
              records only accessible to the police department, educational test
              scores for teachers, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sensitive data</strong> (additional research required):
              <br />
              Sensitive data is private by default. The difference with private
              data, is that the user should have instruments to make claims
              about that data without disclosing it.
            </p>
            <div class="thumb">
              <img src="./images/18.png" alt="sensitive data" />
            </div>
            <p>
              This also includes use cases with privacy-oriented applications
              (like banks) that will process data in a roll-up mode and only
              make claims that it was processed correctly according to
              predefined rules. Shared sequencer usage aggregates sensitive
              transaction data from different rollup-based applications (like
              banks) and stores it in raw format to be accessed later in case of
              issues. Given the potential presence of significant volumes of
              sensitive data, it is imperative to establish robust access
              policies and security protocols.

            <h3 id="hood16">Environment where the system will be deployed</h3>
            <p>
              Nodes can be deployed on any server with sufficient computational
              power. As validator nodes are key components of the system, they
              should be online as much as possible, which is why deploying them
              on cloud services with high uptime (99.9%+) is recommended.
              Validator nodes can also be deployed manually on dedicated
              servers, but additional actions should be taken (like backup power
              supply, reserve data link sources, and geographical disperse).
              Core Backend Services are also important for the system, so the
              same measures may be applied to them. Still, their downtime will
              not corrupt the system security, but rather make some
              functionality unavailable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Applications may decide where to host their components (like
              frontend and backend) on their own, as their downtime will not
              corrupt the Lockton One protocol security. The same logic applies
              to the auditor nodes.
            </p>
            <h3 id="hood17">Open source</h3>
            <p>
              Recognizing the potential benefits of open-source code in specific
              segments of the Lockton One project's codebase, it is noted that
              the entire system remains permissioned and under the control of
              authorized authorities, and the opening of the code is neither
              mandatory nor does it alter the fundamental characteristics of the
              Lockton One project.

              R3 Corda: The platform supports multiple consensus algorithms:
              Single Notary, CFT, and BFT-based. It ensures a high level of
              confidentiality through various approaches, including Selective
              Disclosure, Transaction Tear-offs, and transaction encryption. The
              platform is relatively modular but may be challenging to adapt to
              specific user needs requiring certain custom logics. It offers
              features to support trade, financing, and cross-border payments.
              While it supports smart contracts, their usability is limited.
            </p>
            <p>
              we.trade: The platform utilizes Hyperledger Fabric as the core
              accounting system, ensuring high security and efficiency. It
              doesn't provide privacy by default but offers transaction
              anonymization features. The platform is relatively modular but may
              be challenging to customize for specific user needs. Its primary
              focus is on international trade, with integrations with banks
              being a top priority, making it less accommodating for individual
              projects, especially in DeFi.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ripple: Ripple also focuses on cross-border payments, offering its
              digital currency as an intermediate asset. It stands out for its
              system throughput and low transaction costs, making it more
              efficient than traditional banking transfers in some cases.
              However, it has limitations, such as a significant level of
              centralization (most validator nodes are supported by one company)
              and constraints on creating arbitrary application logic (lack of
              support for Turing-complete contracts).
            </p>
            <p>
              Stellar: The platform uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which
              is highly scalable and resembles a "social consensus" model. It is
              relatively modular but may be challenging to adapt to specific
              user needs, lacking the ability to write arbitrary logic.
              Stellar's key aspects include asset tokenization and decentralized
              exchange, allowing asset exchange without a direct pair of orders
              through intermediate currencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lockton One: The platform employs the QBFT consensus mechanism,
              ensuring high throughput and "instant" finality. It is fully
              modular, allowing the implementation of any required user
              interaction model with the platform and deployed applications
              (applications can have arbitrary logic in their contracts). The
              platform lacks an internal currency for user fee payment; instead,
              computational credits are paid for by application owners,
              confirming their clients' transactions (ensuring the necessary
              throughput within their own application). Additionally, the
              platform combines identity management with privacy, allowing only
              authenticated users to perform required actions without disclosing
              sensitive data, only verifying that the logic is executed
              correctly.

              This document presents the worldview and value system that can
              serve as the foundation for creating a global WEB3 platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              This platform can contribute to the development of an
              infrastructure where nations, emirates, specialized economic
              zones, or major corporations can provide users and businesses with
              specific mechanisms to conduct their activities in accordance with
              established regulatory norms. Monitoring, reporting, and
              compliance procedures are integrated into the architectural design
              of the system, leading to a reduction in operational costs and
              making the industry more accessible to projects of various scales,
              including startups and small enterprises.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, this concept will facilitate the interaction between the
              traditional financial sector and the crypto sector. Additionally,
              banking institutions can use such a platform as a cost-effective
              transport system for any traditional assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many control procedures can be confirmed without disclosing
              personal or sensitive data, which is challenging or even
              impossible in traditional accounting systems. However, the choice,
              as always, remains with the market and is determined by its needs.

            <h3 id="addProtocol">Additional protocol improvements</h3>
            <p>
              Some system components are essential and/or required for the
              system to be operational. They must be implemented in the first
              version of the protocol. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Validator node;</li>
              <li>Auditor node;</li>
              <li>EVM execution;</li>
              <li>Role management module with role-based access control;</li>
              <li>Identity verification module;</li>
              <li>Legal dApp store;</li>
              <li>Account abstraction;</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subTitle">
              <em
                >Other components can be added to the system later in subsequent
                releases.
              </em>
            </p>
            <h4 id="addProtocol1">Iden3 as identity infrastructure core</h4>
            <p>
              Iden3 is the protocol that allows the implementation of
              self-sovereign identity (it means that identity can issue claims
              on another identity, which can be for an individual, an
              organization, or a system/machine). This module will allow us to
              organize user`s identities, manage access policies, and make
              verifiable statements by different organizations and applications.
            </p>
            <p>Use cases:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A university issues a certificate that their student has a
                degree. The university itself also has a certificate from the
                ministry of education. Employers can verify the certificate of
                the student.
              </li>
              <li>
                Brand issues a new collection and wants all its items to be
                verifiable. For each purchase, they create a verifiable claim
                that will allow anyone to verify item authenticity. At the same
                time, item owners can leave some feedback and claim that this
                feedback is indeed from the user that has purchased this item.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="addProtocol2">WebAssembly Virtual Machine</h4>
            <p>Use case:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Lockton Protocol is deployed in country X, with its specific
                set of cryptographic algorithm standards (hash function, digital
                signature, decryption, etc). Those algorithms can be implemented
                as smart contracts to ease integration. However, EVM is quite
                slow, so the parallel WASM virtual machine can significantly
                increase the efficiency of such algorithm execution.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              WASM contracts can act like precompiled contracts in Ethereum, but
              they can be deployed on the network without forks and will be
              executed on a parallel VM. This allows smooth integration for
              computational-intensive business logic.
            </p>
            <h4 id="addProtocol3">Privacy pools</h4>
            <p>
              As data on the Lockton One core can be accessed by many parties
              (like applications), this might impose privacy issues. Privacy
              pools protocol allows the hiding of transaction history by mixing
              assets, ensuring customer privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Basically, it works as follows: accounts send assets to the smart
              contract and then generate proof that they were in some subset of
              users who made deposits to withdraw.
            </p>
            <p>
              As in the Lockton One protocol, all accounts must pass the
              verification procedure; this protocol will not allow the hiding of
              illegally obtained assets from authorities but can make it much
              more difficult to track down users' action history by other
              parties.
            </p>
            <h4 id="addProtocol4">DAO & Voting construction framework</h4>
            <p>Use Cases:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                House residents want to cooperate to manage the house
                collectively. This framework allows them to easily create, set
                up, and manage their community as a decentralized autonomous
                organization. As in the Lockton protocol, all users' identities
                are known, and it is possible to allow only residents to
                participate in the decision-making.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Lockton protocol is deployed in some countries, and in city
                X of that country, city council elections should be made. Voting
                must be held anonymously, but only citizens of that specific
                city have the right to vote.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="thumb">
              <img src="./images/19.png" alt="DAO and voting" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Such use cases can be solved with the DAO & Voting construction
              framework, which will act as a constructor when designing systems
              for collective decision-making. Technically, this will be a set of
              built-in smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof schemes that
              users can configure for their specific needs.
            </p>

              Retrieving sensitive data with zero knowledge
            </h4>
            <p>(additional research is required)</p>
            <p>
              This module will allow making statements about sensitive data
              without its disclosure. It might use zk-SQL as well as other
              engineered circuits, but additional research is required.
            </p>
            <p>Use case:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The employer wants to prove that he has not less/more than X
                employees emigrants, but cannot disclose either their personal
                data or companies employees' records. Using ZK schemes, claims
                about sensitive data can be made without disclosing its exact
                value.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="thumb">

            </div>
            <h4 id="addProtocol6">Shared sequencer</h4>
            <p>(additional research is required)</p>
            <p>
              A shared sequencer can handle atomic cross-rollup operations (when
              transactions are executed on either rollup or are not executed at
              all). It also eliminates a single point of failure of centralized
              sequencer architecture and allows fast transaction finality on
              rollups.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a basis for a decentralized shared sequencer for rollups, we
              suggest the Espresso Sequencer. It uses a very resilient
              multi-layer data availability module (the main goal of it is to
              store sequenced batched transactions so that they can be accessed
              later on). As the government controls the Lockton network, there
              is not much need to use such secure and resource-intensive DA
              infrastructure as Espresso Sequencer is using. The second layer,
              which keeps full data chunk blocks on multiple DA nodes, should be
              enough as long as we trust the government to keep most of the DA
              nodes operational (malfunction in some will not cause the system
              to crash).
            </p>
            <p>Use case:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bank X and Y are deployed on the Lockton protocol as rollups.
                The client wants to transfer funds from bank X to bank Y, so the
                cross-rollup transaction is required. A shared sequencer is used
                to execute transactions on both rollups atomically.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="thumb">

            <p>(additional research is required)</p>
            <p>
              Rollups based on zero-knowledge proofs are required to provide
              services that require privacy (like banks) and also to scale the
              network. On the other hand, the Lockton protocol is designed to be
              controlled by the authorities, which means applications cannot
              just create arbitrary validity verification on rollups. That is
              why those rollups must be constructed from predefined building
              blocks that are approved by the authorities.
