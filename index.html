            <p>
              In the modern world, blockchain technology emerges as an exciting
              and rapidly evolving field, transforming into a distinct era in
              the history of digital solutions. We believe that sooner or later,
              all accounting systems will leverage the properties of this
              technology. The unique ability to provide decentralized and
              transparent systems has become an integral part of this evolution,
              opening new horizons for various industries. However, against this
              innovative progress, new challenges and issues arise, demanding
              solutions.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <p>
              Fraud schemes exploiting the complexities of blockchain regulation
              are becoming more sophisticated and challenging to overcome. As a
              result, regular users find themselves grappling with security
              threats and the complexity of engaging with innovative
              technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, the average user must consider a myriad of factors when
              managing digital assets:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Security: Striking a balance between easy access to funds and
                  avoiding the risk of losing money due to an irresponsible
                  service provider.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Provable Non-Involvement: Monitoring incoming and outgoing
                  transactions for the involvement of transferred funds in
                  various fraudulent schemes or theft.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Recoverability: Choosing between backing up keys (and how to
                  do so) or opting for asset insurance (and trusting the digital
                  asset insurer).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Manageability: Building a sensible budget management
                  structure, both for personal use and for a managed company
                  budget.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Audibility: Verifying that the logic of decentralized
                  applications truly aligns with the declared goals. Checking
                  for intentional or accidental vulnerabilities in smart
                  contract code.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This is not an exhaustive list, but it suffices to understand that
              effective and secure management of digital assets is a
              labor-intensive process and a comprehensive solution that an
              ordinary user may not always afford.
            </p>
            <p>
              The contrast between the potential of blockchain and the real
              issues faced by users underscores the need for efficient
              regulatory mechanisms and the protection of the interests of
              ordinary participants. This is crucial to ensure the sustainable
              development and safe integration of blockchain into everyday life,
              collectively reducing entry barriers and costs for end-users.

              Blockchain technology is rapidly penetrating various sectors,
              providing unique opportunities. However, on its path to
              integration into the world, there are already significant problems
              that require serious attention and effective regulation.

              <b><em>ICO Problem: Litmus Test for Fraud</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
              The approach to Initial Coin Offering (ICO), despite its
              popularity, is becoming a platform for fraud. Many projects, using
              promises of high returns, attract investors but turn out to be
              nothing more than a deception. Ponzi schemes and pump-and-dump
              manipulations become commonplace, harming the interests of
              trusting investors. In turn, this also affects good projects -
              users fail to use clear criteria in their selection, and, having
              learned from bitter experience, lump everything related to
              "crypto" under one brush.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b><em>Lack of Consumer Protection and Taxation Threats</em></b>
            </p>
            <p>
              Blockchain technology provides anonymity (more precisely -
              pseudonymity) when managing digital assets, hiding the real user
              behind an anonymized address. This can lead (and naturally leads)
              to tax evasion and money laundering. Moreover, due to the
              decentralized nature, the lines of taxation are significantly
              blurred - P2P payments are truly P2P; they do not require
              intermediaries or connections between financial institutions for
              processing. The transaction can be initiated directly by the user,
              and its confirmation can be done by an unknown validator. Thanks
              to the mathematical transparency of events in the blockchain,
              regulators can happily observe what is happening, but in reality,
              there is little they can do to protect consumers.
            </p>
            <h3 id="intr2">Between Dreams and Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              The global cryptocurrency market, promising potentially high
              returns, faces a range of issues undermining its stability and
              reliability. One of the main problems is the lack of clear and
              enforceable rules. In such a semi-regulated environment, investors
              often fall victim to fraud, and the absence of legal protection
              only exacerbates the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regulators, seeking to gain control over the crypto industry,
              often employ outdated approaches that could be more effective and
              more counterproductive. For instance, the SEC directly combats
              services and projects, while regional regulators tighten
              regulatory screws, increasing the cost of entry for new solutions
              to enter the market.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <p>
              However, the cryptocurrency market can become an excellent tool
              for expanding the possibilities of the traditional financial
              market. It helps balance the growing volume of assets not backed
              by a solid component.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current regulatory requirements prove cumbersome and convoluted,
              increasing legal risks for market participants or pushing them
              into the "gray" area. For a market based on high technologies, an
              appropriate <strong>high-tech regulatory </strong>approach is
              necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the crypto enthusiasts' environment, the distorted perception
              of freedoms leads to the idealization of the industry as a utopian
              ecosystem. Absolute freedom is more likely to lead to chaos than
              harmony, as the absence of any rules and regulations creates a
              fertile ground for fraud, crime, and other negative phenomena. In
              the financial sector, anarchy has little in common with freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
              For participants who want to operate in accordance with the legal
              framework and have maximum compatibility with the traditional
              financial sector, the implementation of clear criteria and rules
              by regulators is the only possible scenario. Users who do not want
              to engage with the regulated segment can continue to leverage the
              properties of decentralized systems, as before.

              its citizens' interests. Therefore, any attempts to create and
              issue digital assets without proper control will be considered a
              threat to economic stability and possibly as unlawful activity.

              <em
                >In some blockchain networks, such as Ethereum 2.0, validators
                must stake cryptocurrency. This incentivizes validators to act
                honestly and in the network's best interests. It's evident that
                in regulated systems, any party contributing collateral cannot
                become a validator. Therefore, a separate reputation-based
                mechanism is required.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Validators in a blockchain network play a crucial role by
              confirming the mathematical correctness of transactions and
              ensuring the system's security and maintenance. The presence of
              high-quality validators (government entities, major companies)
              reduces the need for a large number of them. In cryptocurrencies,
              the fate of the system is determined by the majority of unknown
              participants; in a regulated environment, it could be a few
              reputable and trusted organizations (playing by common and
              pre-established rules). Reducing the number of validators enhances
              system throughput and reduces redundancy (costs + computational
              power).
            </p>
            <p>
              Public transparency of validators strengthens the trust of users
              and regulators. The quality and responsibility of validators are
              essential for creating a reliable and resilient blockchain system.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, a separate role in such infrastructures belongs
              to auditors - participants who do not participate in achieving
              consensus but store and synchronize the current state of the
              accounting system to monitor and control all actions performed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, any accredited organization can enhance the transparency of
              processes in the accounting system without impacting its
              throughput.
            </p>
            <h3 id="intr5">Rollups as a way to scale</h3>
            <p>
              <em
                >As of December 27, 2023, over 30 second-layer solutions are
                utilizing Rollup technologies.</em
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let's touch upon the issue of network scalability. The
              throughput of any system, whether centralized or not, is limited.
              For some systems, this limitation is within the range of 3-5
              transactions per second (tps), while for others, it can be tens of
              thousands of tps. As the level of decentralization increases, the
              reverse effect becomes a decrease in its throughput (influencing
              the consensus process among validators).
            </p>
            <p>
              Another crucial aspect is unpredictability. When designing an
              accounting system, developers must consider the potential load on
              it. Depending on these requirements, specific technologies may be
              chosen for implementation (consensus mechanism, accounting model,
              etc.). However, if situations of overestimated load don't
              critically impact the system, underestimating it leads to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  competition within block limits and consequently, an increase
                  in transaction fees;
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><p>service denial to users who cannot compete.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              One method of scaling an accounting system is through rollups. A
              key distinction is their ability to launch parallel subsystems
              without altering the basic architecture of the accounting system
              (unlike sharding). At the L1 level, each such subsystem is
              represented by a verification smart contract, periodically
              updating the state.
            </p>
            <p>
              Briefly, the functioning of zkRollups can be described as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  1. Users submit transactions to L2 (second-level subsystems)
                  that operate concurrently with the main network. Transactions
                  stand out for their speed and cost-effectiveness.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  2. The L2 operator (sequencer) aggregates these transactions
                  into a single "rollup" or "batch." The operator generates a
                  zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARK) confirming the validity of all
                  transactions in the rollup, adhering to the network rules.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  3. This "batch" of transactions and the zero-knowledge proof
                  are sent to the main network. Validators on the main network
                  verify the proof (regarding state transition). After
                  successful proof verification, all transactions in the rollup
                  are considered confirmed on the main network (considering
                  assumptions about the finality of the main network).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  4. The state of accounts or smart contracts involved in these
                  transactions is updated on the main network, taking into
                  account all transactions conducted on L2.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              It's also important to note that the proof of the validity of the
              final state of the rollup can be verified by any participant in
              the network.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <p>
              The key advantage of zk-rollups is their ability to process a
              large number of transactions off the main chain, followed by the
              submission of only the final state hash and proof to the main
              blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              This increases significantly the network throughput and reduces
              transaction costs, making the technology highly appealing for a
              wide range of solutions, from financial operations to
              decentralized applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, a bit about zkEVM. Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine is
              a technology that aims to combine zero-knowledge proof technology
              with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              While some zk rollups can efficiently aggregate simple
              transactions like digital asset transfers, implementing them for
              smart contracts is challenging. zkEVM represents an attempt to
              make zero-knowledge proofs compatible with the full functionality
              of the EVM, including all OP codes.
            </p>
            <img src="" alt="" />
            <p>Why it matters:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  A developer creates a smart contract and deploys it on L2
                  (zkEVM-compatible).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><p>Transactions are initially processed on L2.</p></li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  After several transactions are bundled in a rollup, a
                  zero-knowledge proof (zkp) is generated for the entire
                  package.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Then, this proof is verified and recorded on the main network.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  After successful verification, the state of all involved smart
                  contracts is updated on the main network.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              In an era where blockchain technologies become an integral part of
              the financial and corporate world, zero-knowledge rollups stand
              out as one of the most promising solutions for optimizing
              throughput and enhancing confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p>
              These algorithmic constructs not only simplify the transactional
              load on the main network but also provide cryptographic anonymity,
              allowing validation of transactions without revealing their
              content. In this combination, we achieve mathematically
              substantiated anonymity that satisfies regulators.
            </p>
            <p>
              The integration of this technology represents a step forward in
              creating more efficient, secure, and scalable blockchain
              ecosystems.

            </ul>
            <p>
              Now, in accordance with the criteria outlined above, let's
              describe the capabilities of the "ideal" platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Such a platform provides an environment where each user has a
              significant number of rights and freedoms. These freedoms are
              based on the platform's ability to control user actions to comply
              with established policies. The ability to generate real-time
              reports is ensured without revealing private information. In the
              context of the modern financial world, where the presumption of
              guilt prevails over objectivity, this platform creates a fairer
              and more transparent environment, addressing issues of bias and
              lack of transparency in financial matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              This system ensures privacy until a breach of the law (certain
              system rules) occurs.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's an honest and fair agreement that eliminates the need to
              exaggerate requirements or prohibit certain operations that the
              regulator could not track before.
            </p>
            <p>
              In such a system, it's sufficient to undergo the identification
              process once, after which compliance checks can be conducted in
              various services without disclosing personal data. These features
              apply not only to applications deployed on the main platform but
              also to all connected rollups.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, let's add the ability to work with hundreds of
              crypto assets in various network services, including the ability
              to create your own smart contracts, launch L2 projects, integrate
              with the network via APIs, and provide network services to your
              users, even if you have a small project!
            </p>
            <p>
              A platform built on these principles will be distributed among
              institutional validators, and fishers, owners of full nodes
              (auditor nodes), representing the community, will be responsible
              for public control.
            </p>
            <p>
              For a regulator owning such a system, there is no need to set
              procedural barriers, restrict the banking sector from the crypto
              segment, or prohibit any activity due to the inability to control
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The legal framework, designed with technological regulation in
              mind, will be concise and enforceable, and the deployment of a
              platform capable of attracting a wave of investments to the region
              is possible in a short period.
            </p>
            <p>
              Society is quite accepting of existing state telecommunications
              networks, unitary railway and aviation enterprises. Why can't
              state blockchain platforms emerge? It's an excellent consolidating
              solution for the circulation of crypto assets, launching projects,
              and operating existing services willing to work within the legal
              framework of specific jurisdictions!
